# rAthena-long-path
The following project try to understand the [Rathena](https://github.com/rathena/rathena) pathfinding and the client pathfinding, at the same time provide solutions for the pathfiding issues/problems, the mods are made exclusively on files that may be affected to avoid overloading the project with "unnecessary" elements that may reduce the search among the scritps.

# List of task
This list can be updated in future, just said the current progressions and objectives.
:white_check_mark: Add basic Long Path.
:x: Complex Path (avoid walls more natural walk).
:x: Flexible Path (improve the uses of dynamic sizes, more optimal).
:x: Force Path (move npc to a destination even if no reach the goal).
:x: Improve A* pathfinding (if is possible).
:x: Bypass client limitation of 32 blocks of memory (this could be impossible with my knowledge).

# Introduction

The following document was developed in the earliest version of the code, and it superficially talk about the problem to provide an understanding or initiation, even so it is likely to have some errors due to my own outdated knowledge, but I still consider that it can help to understand the problem without enter in technicalities (for the other I recommend the wiki)
